In this article, we will show you how to use Serial Monitor ED to monitor, log and analyze serial ports activity, parse protocol packets data (such as MODBUS, BACnet MSTP, PPP), create and send packets to the devices using built-in serial terminal, send MODBUS commands, streamline your work with scripting and more.
  
## What is Serial Monitor ED?
 
Serial Monitor ED is a non-intrusive software COM ports sniffer, RS232/RS422/RS485 serial protocol analyzer and data logger for Windows. It works by installing a filter driver on top of a serial device driver and intercepting all I/O requests issued by applications. It then passes each request to a running monitoring session within Serial Monitor for further analysis.
 
Serial Monitor ED supports a wide range of data protocols to parse each intercepted data transfer request. You can also add your own protocols using the simple yet powerful protocol definition language. Serial Monitor ED provides various visualization tools for popular serial protocols (including PPP, MODBUS, BACnet MSTP) and raw data, as well as utilities for creating your own custom visualizers.
 
In addition to visualizers, Serial Monitor ED includes tools for data exporting, reproducing data from previously recorded log files, redirecting this data to COM ports, advanced serial port terminal, utility for sending MODBUS Commands and built-in scripting for tools automation.
 
Serial Monitor ED is entirely a software solution that allows you to avoid using hardware equipment, null-modem cable, additional DB-25 or DB-9 connectors and so on. It has an intuitive user interface, detailed documentation with examples and requires no special programming skills to start using it.
